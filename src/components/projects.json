The game allows dynamic joining and exiting of players, constant syncing of clients, and a synced place-in-queue counter.",

The domain was purchased using Google Domains, and a script used to run hourly to update the Dynamic DNS. Now, it is hosted on Vercel.",

The goal is to see the forces being applied to a building or structure in real time as it is tested in a structural testing lab. This would be achieved by putting on a pair of Augmented Reality (AR) goggles and seeing the forces represented on top of a real world object. AR goggles have the ability to draw computer graphics on top of a user's view of the outside world. The forces will be represented via color, allowing the user to easily see which parts of the building are under stress at any given time.",
